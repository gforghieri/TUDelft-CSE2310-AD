# Algorithms Design

Expected prior knowledge	
Required:
• programming experience from CSE1100 or equivalent

Strongly advised:
• experience with algorithms and data structures (priority queue, graph algorithms etc) such as from Algorithms and Datastructures (CSE1305);
• experience with constructing proofs, such as from Reasoning and logic (CSE1300)
Course Contents	
After completing this course, the student can apply, reproduce, and give relevant properties and definitions of
1. graph algorithms,
2. greedy algorithms
3. divide and conquer,
4. dynamic programming and
5. network flow algorithms.
The student can also
6. prove the correctness of these algorithms,
7. determine the running time of algorithms both analytically as well as experimentally,
8. implement algorithms efficiently, and
9. provide well-argued advice about which problems can be solved best using which algorithms.
